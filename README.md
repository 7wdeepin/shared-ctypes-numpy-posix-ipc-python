# Sharing `Ctypes` Structure and `NumPy NdArray` between Unrelated Processes Using POSIX Shared Memory in Python3

The repo demonstrates how to use POSIX shared memory to implement the communication between unrelated processes. You can find here examples of following use cases:

* POSIX Shared Memory
* POSIX Semaphore
* Ctypes Structure in shared memory
* NumPy Ndarray in shared memory
