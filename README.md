# Sharing Ctypes Structures and NumPy Arrays in Unrelated Processes Using POSIX Shared Memory in Python

The repo demonstrates how to use POSIX shared memory to implement the communication between unrelated processes. You can find here examples of following use cases:

* POSIX Shared Memory
* POSIX Semaphore
* Ctypes Structure in shared memory
* NumPy Ndarray in shared memory
